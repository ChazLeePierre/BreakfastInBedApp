# Breakfast In Bed App

This project is an application that allows hotel users to order breakfast in bed right from the comfort of their room. It was developed using Angular and .NET Core 3.1. I was requested to develop this application by a potential employer. The specifications of the task was to develop a web application (48 hour time limit) that accepts customer information that is filled in by the end-user. The company is one of the biggest players in the hospitality industry, so I thought a hotel/breakfast in bed web app was a good choice. I had fun with this task & felt like I got to showcase some of my creativity. The employer liked my solution & I was recruited to the company.
